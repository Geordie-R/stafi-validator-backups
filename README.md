# Stafi Validator Backups and Restores (Under Construction)
Backups and Restores of stafi validators blocks.json

This project is the first iteration of a backups and restore solution for stafi, which will then be expanded to hopefully be for any substrate chain.  I'm no expert on substrate so this might start out a bit crazy! So be careful trying this on a live stafi chain!

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Geordie-R/stafi-validator-backups.git geordiertools
find * -type f -iname "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
```
