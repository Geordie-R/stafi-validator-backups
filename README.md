# Stafi Validator Backups and Restores Beta (Geordiertools)
Backups and Restores of stafi validators blocks db.

This project is the first iteration of a node backups and restore solution for stafi, which will then be expanded to hopefully be for any substrate chain.  I'm no expert on substrate so this might start out a bit crazy! So be careful trying this on a live stafi chain!

I have done a video a few months back. See the link below for instructions and video.
